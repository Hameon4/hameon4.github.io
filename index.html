								<h2 class="major">ABOUT</h2>
								<p>
									Welcome to my digital portfolio. Similar to my resume, I provide 
									my academic bakground in this website. Albeit being an engineer, I find
									it fun creating websites, and because I am a big fan of sci-fi/futuristic UIs
									like the ones seen in movies (e.g. Iron Man), I made mine look like one.
								</p>
								<p>I am a graduate from U.A.E University (UAEU) with a Bacherlor's Degree in Computer Engineering</p>
								<p>Some of the recent technical hobbies I picked up are web development, and most recently 
									<strong>computer vision</strong> using python or c++.

								<h3>SCOOTER INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEM</h3>
								<p>
									This was my Senior Project where my team and I designed an <strong>attachable device</strong> to an e-scooter as well as the algorithm 
									whose duty is to detect a fall, collision, or a crash from the escooter and transmit the data to the IoT platform via Wi-Fi. 
									The IoT platform utilized was Thinger.io. 									
								</p>
								<p>
									The algorithm we developed tracks the movement of the scooter. High spikes of frequency on the IoT platform's dashboard indicate a high
									possibility of an accident. The algorithm then sends a an email providing an alert as well as the device's ID and location, so help
									can arrive ASAP.
								</p>
								<p>
									Much thought came among my team and I on improving the product such as adding a panic button that shall reduce the chances 
									of false negatives. We also thought of icorporating a speaker/mic setup using VoIP to enable continuous communication
									with the monitoring team when required. And when possible, utilizing AI to teach the system how falls happen and make it
									predict them when one occurs.

								<h3>On-Board Computer (OBC) Simulator</h3>
								<p>
									As my main task during my internship at the National Space Science and Technology Center (NSSTC) 
									at UAEU, I developed a desktop (GUI) simulation software, using Python and Arduino, that acts as a replica
									to the telecommand/telemetry process in the  satellite with UART as the communication protocol. 									
								</p>
								<p>
									The first prototype was a CLI app, 
									which I then modified it to a second and the go-to prototype: the GUI app.
								</p>

								<h3>HOTEL RESERVATION WEBSITE</h3>
								<p>
									Built a full-stacked website using frontend tools (HTML, CSS, JS) with PHP as the backend and MySQL as the database. This was my 
									end-of-term Software Engineering Fundamentals course project in which the goal was to provide the software design planning 
									(i.e. purpose/scope of the system, functional/non-functional requirements, use-case/class/sequence diagrams).
								</p>
								<p>
									Following that was demonstrating it
									by building an app (either web-app or GUI), which in my case was a website. I managed to display the data from the database into the website
									UI with only the admin's account can access. I also managed to automate the user creation process and save the person's
									information into the database.
