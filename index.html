								<h2 class="major">ABOUT</h2>
								<p>
									Welcome to my digital portfolio. Similar to my resume, 
									I provide my academic background on this website. Albeit being an engineer, 
									I find it fun creating sites, and because I am a big fan of sci-fi/futuristic 
									UIs like the ones seen in movies (like Iron Man), I made mine look like one.
								</p>
								<p>I am a graduate of U.A.E University (UAEU) with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering.</p>
								<p>Some of the recent technical hobbies I picked up are web development, and, most recently,
									 <strong>computer vision</strong> using python or c++, and currently trying it on Rust.

								<h3>SCOOTER INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEM</h3>
								<p>
									This was my Senior Project where my team and I designed an attachable device to an e-scooter, 
									including the algorithm whose duty is to detect a fall, collision, or a crash from the e-scooter 
									and transmit the data to the IoT platform via Wi-Fi. The IoT platform utilized was Thinger.io.									
								</p>
								<p>
									The algorithm we developed tracks the movement of the scooter. 
									High spikes on the IoT platform's dashboard indicate a high possibility of an accident. 
									The algorithm then sends an email providing an alert, including the device's ID and 
									location so help can arrive ASAP.
								</p>
								<p>
									Much thought came among my team and me on improving the product, such as adding a panic button
								    that can reduce the chances of false negatives. We also thought of incorporating a speaker/mic 
									setup using VoIP to enable continuous communication with the monitoring team when required. 
									And when possible, utilize AI to teach the system how falls happen and make it predict them 
									when they occur.

								<h3>On-Board Computer (OBC) Simulator</h3>
								<p>
									As my main task during my internship at the National Space Science and Technology Center (NSSTC) 
									at UAEU, I developed a desktop (GUI) simulating software, using Python and Arduino, 
									that acts as a replica of the telecommand/telemetry process in the satellite with UART 
									as the communication protocol. 									
								</p>
								<p>
									The initial prototype was a CLI app, which I then modified to a second, and the go-to prototype: 
									the GUI app. The framework used was Python's Tkinter.
								</p>

								<h3>HOTEL RESERVATION WEBSITE</h3>
								<p>
									Built a full-stacked website using frontend tools (HTML, CSS, JS) with PHP as the backend and MySQL as the database. This was my 
									end-of-term Software Engineering Fundamentals course project in which the goal was to provide the software design planning 
									(i.e. purpose/scope of the system, functional/non-functional requirements, use-case/class/sequence diagrams).
								</p>
								<p>
									Following that was demonstrating it
									by building an app (either web-app or GUI), which in my case was a website. I managed to display the data from the database into the website
									UI with only the admin's account can access. I also managed to automate the user creation process and save the person's
									information into the database.
